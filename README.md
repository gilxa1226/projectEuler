# Project Euler

This repository contains the source code for my personal Project Euler problem solutions.  Right now they are 100% in java, however I do plan on re-implementing in different languages as an educational process both for me, and to see runtime differences.

# Platform

Currently the respository contains a Netbeans (www.netbeans.org) project which can be loaded in and built against any version of Netbeans.

# Design

All projects are built as standalone classes with implement a Project interface.  The Project interface has a single method: Run, which takes no parameters.
